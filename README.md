# IMdb-Clone<br>
I have created imdb clone using html , css and javascript.<br>
I have used OMDB api.<br>
Features :- <br>
1) Home Page:-<br>
Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update).<br>
Each search result of the movie should have an add to favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourites”.<br>
Also there is more button to open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page).<br>
<br>
2) Movie Page:-<br>
Information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc.<br>
<br>
3) My favourite movies Page:-<br>
List of all the favourite movie (persistent).<br>
Remove from favourites button: Clicking on which that movie get removed from the list.
